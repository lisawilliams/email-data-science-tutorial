# An Email Data Science Tutorial

This repository contains files to be used in conjunction with [Email Data Science Tutorial: Setting Up & Using The Shorenstein Notebooks](https://lisawilliams.github.io/lisa/tech/2018/03/12/email-data-science-tutorial.html).

This tutorial shows you how to use the Jupyter Notebooks created by The Shorenstein Center to analyze email newsletter subscriber data in a much deeper and more interesting way than most email platforms allow.

To learn more about The Shorenstein Center's work on using data science tools to build better email products, see [Shorenstein Center: Email Analysis Research Guide](https://shorensteincenter.org/email-analysis-research-guide/).
